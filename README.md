# passwordgenerator

My task was to generate a random password based on user preference of including special characters, upper and lower case letters as well as numbers. 

The user is able to choose the length of the password which is strictly set between 8-128 characters long. 

I created multiple lists of arrays that take in different values for password characters.

I then created an empty array that would take in the values from the list of arrays, once the user selects preference of including or not.  

I created functions, if/else statements, and for-loops for all prompts and confirm line items 

I created a function to generate the password associated with user selected preference criteria
